# raddsl — a toolset for rapid prototyping of [DSL compilers](http://composition.al/blog/2017/04/30/what-isnt-a-high-performance-dsl/)

Two combinator-based libraries (eDSLs) written in Python:

1. *parse.py* for syntax analysis: PEG, scannerless parsing, selective memoization, Pratt parser.
1. *rewrite.py* for AST transformations: strategic term rewriting.
